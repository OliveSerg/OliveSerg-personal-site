# OliveSerg Personal Website

Personal website built with React frontend and a Django backend

## Considerations

The site was made to understand RESTful API systems better and gaining experience with React and Django. Ideally this personal site could be just a react app or it could be a django app with react integrated into the static portion of the site. The AI portion of the site is leveraged externally anyways.
